# US 1008


## 1. Context

* This task was included in the team's to-do list during sprint 2
  and is expected to be finished within the same sprint.

## 2. Requirements

**US 1008** As Language Engineer, I want to deploy and configure a plugin (i.e., Job Requirement Specification or Interview Model) to be used by the system.

– Priority: 1

– References: See NFR09(LPROG).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- 1008.1. The system should provide a mechanism for Language Engineers to deploy and configure plugins seamlessly.

- 1008.2. Each plugin should be configurable with parameters specific to its functionality.

- 1008.3. Language Engineers should be able to enable/disable plugins as needed

## 3. Analysis

In this section, the team conducted an analysis to understand the requirements and dependencies of deploying and configuring plugins within the system. We examined existing plugin architectures and identified key components necessary for seamless integration and configuration.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

The realization of the functionality involves providing a user-friendly interface for Language Engineers to manage plugins within the system. This interface should allow deployment, configuration, enabling, and disabling of plugins.

### 4.2. Class Diagram

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

### 4.4. Tests

Include here the main tests used to validate the functionality. Focus on how they relate to the acceptance criteria.

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to ...*

**Refers to Acceptance Criteria:** G002.1


```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureXxxxYyyy() {
	...
}
````

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of the plugin deployment and configuration functionality aligns with the design specifications outlined above. Regular code reviews and automated tests ensure that the implementation adheres to the intended functionality.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

Efforts were made to integrate the plugin management functionality seamlessly with other components of the system. Language Engineers can access the plugin management interface to deploy, configure, enable, and disable plugins as needed. Detailed instructions for demonstration will be provided upon request, including accessing the user interface for plugin management and performing necessary operations.
