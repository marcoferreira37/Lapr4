# US 2001


## 1. Context

* This task was included in the team's to-do list during sprint 2
  and is expected to be finished within the same sprint.

## 2. Requirements

**US 2001** As Product Owner, I want the system to, continuously, process the files produced by the Applications Email Bot, so that they can be imported into the system by initiative of the Operator.

– Priority: 1

– References: See NFR12(SCOMP).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 2001.1. The system should continuously monitor for files produced by the Applications Email Bot.

- 2001.2. Upon detection of a new file, the system should initiate the import process automatically.

- 2001.3. The import process should handle the file according to predefined rules and mappings, ensuring accurate data integration into the system.

## 3. Analysis

* In this section, the team conducted an analysis to understand the requirements and dependencies of continuously processing files produced by the Applications Email Bot. We examined existing file processing systems and identified key components necessary for seamless integration and efficient data handling.

## 4. Design

The objective is to design a system that continuously monitors the files produced by the Applications Email Bot and processes them for import into the main system. This design will ensure seamless integration and data flow between the Email Bot and the main system.

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of the file processing functionality aligns with the design specifications outlined above. Regular code reviews and automated tests ensure that the implementation adheres to the intended functionality.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

Efforts were made to integrate the file processing functionality seamlessly with other components of the system. Detailed instructions for demonstration will be provided upon request, including setting up the file monitoring process, simulating the creation of new files, and observing the import process initiated automatically by the system.
