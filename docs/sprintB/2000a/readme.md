Registration Form:

A web form must be created for the Operator to input the candidate's details.
Required fields: name, email, phone number, address, and other relevant information.
The form should have validation to ensure all mandatory fields are filled and data formats are correct (e.g., valid email format).
User Account Creation:

The system should automatically generate a user account upon successful form submission.
The user account must include a unique username and a secure, initial password.
Data Storage:

Candidate details and the corresponding user account information must be stored in a relational database.
Ensure data integrity and enforce constraints such as unique email addresses.
Confirmation Message:

The system should provide feedback to the Operator about the success or failure of the registration process.
A confirmation message should include the candidateâ€™s username and any further steps, such as password change instructions.
