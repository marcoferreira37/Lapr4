## 2. Requirements

**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

## 3. Analysis

* This user story involves the creation and organization of new directories that will be used in the future to execute and store future User Stories.

* This User Story doesn't depend on any other User Stories.
* There's no need for design work, testing, or integrations as part of this task.
