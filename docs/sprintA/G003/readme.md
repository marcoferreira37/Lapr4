* I interpret this User Story as involving the creation of new directories to manage C code.
* Additionally, there might be a requirement to prepare something related to ANTLR in the Lprog context, though I need to explore this further.
* This User Story doesn't depend on any other User Stories.
* There's no need for design work, testing, or integrations as part of this task.
