# US G003

## 1. Context

* This task was included in the team's to-do list during sprint 1 
  and is expected to be finished within the same sprint.

## 2. Requirements

**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

– Priority: 1

– References: Define the structure of the project to support the envisioned architecture, such as presented in Chapter 4, including support for adopted technologies
(e.g., ANTLR)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G003.1. The system should be ready to the next sprints in terms of project structure;

## 3. Analysis

* This user story involves the creation and organization of new directories that will be used in the future to execute and store future User Stories.
* Furthermore, with a view to accelerating the development of future user stories, all members of the group will install and explore some capabilities of the Tool for Language Recognition ANTLR.
* This User Story doesn't depend on any other User Stories.
* There's no need for design work, testing, or integrations as part of this task. 

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

* New directories were created for the project where the next User Stories will be allocated. This also forced the interpetation and analysis of future USs.

* With a view to accelerating the development of future user stories all group members installed ANTLR Language Recognition Tool and explored some of its features.

### 4.2. Class Diagram

*As this aspect of the requirement pertains more to project setup and configuration rather than software design,
a class diagram is not applicable in this context.*

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

*No specific design patterns are applied in this scenario.*

### 4.4. Tests
* Given the nature of this requirement, direct testing is not applicable.
  However, the success of this step can be validated by looking at the current project structure.

## 5. Implementation

*There was no implementation required.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration
* For this change in the structure of the project, it was necessary for the group's members to look at what was announced and interpret and analyze it in the best way. 
 
* Furthermore, it was also extremely important that we see all future User Stories so that we can prepare properly for the next sprints in which these will be developed.

## 7. Observations

* None until now
