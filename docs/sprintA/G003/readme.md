# US G003

## 1. Context

* This task was included in the team's to-do list during sprint 1 
  and is expected to be finished within the same sprint.

## 2. Requirements

**US G003** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate/accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

– Priority: 1

– References: Define the structure of the project to support the envisioned architecture, such as presented in Chapter 4, including support for adopted technologies
(e.g., ANTLR)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G003.1. The system should be ready to the next sprints in terms of project structure;

## 3. Analysis

* This user story involves the creation and organization of new directories that will be used in the future to execute and store future User Stories.
* Furthermore, with a view to accelerating the development of future user stories, all members of the group will install and explore some capabilities of the  Tool for Language Recognition ANTLR.
* This User Story doesn't depend on any other User Stories.
* There's no need for design work, testing, or integrations as part of this task. 

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

*The chosen solution involves creating a GitHub repository with a name that accurately reflects the project's purpose or name.
The repository serves as a centralized location for storing all project-related files, including source code, documentation,
and any supplementary resources.*
*The repository allows team members to report and address project-related issues effectively, fostering a proactive
approach to problem-solving and project management.*

### 4.2. Class Diagram

*As this aspect of the requirement pertains more to project setup and configuration rather than software design,
a class diagram is not applicable in this context.*

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

*No specific design patterns are applied in this scenario, as the focus is on setting up the project repository on
GitHub rather than implementing software functionality.*

### 4.4. Tests
- Given the nature of this requirement, direct testing is not applicable.
  However, the success of this step can be validated through manual inspection and verification,
  ensuring that the GitHub repository is created with an appropriate name and configured according to the project's needs

## 5. Implementation

*There was no implementation required.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration
*Integration efforts involved ensuring seamless collaboration between team members
within the GitHub repository and utilizing project management tools for efficient
task tracking and communication.*  
*This integration enhances overall project organization and productivity.*

## 7. Observations

* None until now
