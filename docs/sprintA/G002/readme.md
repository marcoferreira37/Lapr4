# US G002

## 1. Context

*This user story involves setting up the project repository and 
configuring a project management tool.*

## 2. Requirements

*Project Repository (GitHub): Create a GitHub repository for the project to store all project-related files
and source code. It will facilitate collaboration, version control, and document management.* 
*Project Management Tool: Choose and set up a project management tool to streamline project planning, 
task tracking, and communication. It will enable task assignment, progress monitoring, and issue management.*

**US G002** As Project Manager I Want the team to use the defined project 
repository and set up a tool for project management;

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**G002.1.** GitHub repository is created with an appropriate name that reflects the project's purpose or name.

**G002.2.** Team members are added to the GitHub repository with the appropriate permissions, 
allowing them to collaborate and contribute to the project.

**G002.3.** Initial project files, including README, and any relevant documentation, are added to the GitHub repository.

**G002.4.** The project repository is organized into relevant folders or categories to facilitate easy navigation and 
access to project resources.

**G002.5.** The GitHub repository is configured to enable issue tracking, 
allowing team members to report and address project-related issues effectively.

**Dependencies/References:**

- No dependencies were found.

## 3. Analysis

*During the analysis stage, the team carefully looked at different things to decide on the best tools for starting the project and managing it. 
One important thing we considered was which version control system to use, which is really important for working on software together. 
They found that GitHub was a strong option because a lot of people use it, it has a lot of useful features, and it is easy to work with*

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

*The chosen solution involves creating a GitHub repository with a name that accurately reflects the project's purpose or name. 
The repository serves as a centralized location for storing all project-related files, including source code, documentation,
and any supplementary resources.*
*The repository allows team members to report and address project-related issues effectively, fostering a proactive 
approach to problem-solving and project management.*

### 4.2. Class Diagram

*As this aspect of the requirement pertains more to project setup and configuration rather than software design, 
a class diagram is not applicable in this context.*

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

*No specific design patterns are applied in this scenario, as the focus is on setting up the project repository on 
GitHub rather than implementing software functionality.*

### 4.4. Tests
- Given the nature of this requirement, direct testing is not applicable. 
However, the success of this step can be validated through manual inspection and verification,
ensuring that the GitHub repository is created with an appropriate name and configured according to the project's needs.

## 5. Implementation

*There was no implementation required.* 

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

*We made sure everyone on the team could work together smoothly using GitHub, 
and we used project management tools to keep track of tasks and communicate efficiently. 
This setup helps us stay organized and productive throughout the project.*

## 7. Observations

*No observations.*
