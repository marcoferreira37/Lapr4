## 1. Context

*This user story involves setting up the project repository and 
configuring a project management tool.*

## 2. Requirements

*Project Repository (GitHub): Create a GitHub repository for the project to store all project-related files
and source code. It will facilitate collaboration, version control, and document management.* 
*Project Management Tool: Choose and set up a project management tool to streamline project planning, 
task tracking, and communication. It will enable task assignment, progress monitoring, and issue management.*

**US G002** As Project Manager I Want the team to use the defined project 
repository and set up a tool for project management;

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**G002.1.** GitHub repository is created with an appropriate name that reflects the project's purpose or name.

**G002.2.** Team members are added to the GitHub repository with the appropriate permissions, 
allowing them to collaborate and contribute to the project.

**G002.3.** Initial project files, including README, and any relevant documentation, are added to the GitHub repository.

**G002.4.** The project repository is organized into relevant folders or categories to facilitate easy navigation and 
access to project resources.

**G002.5.** Version control mechanisms, such as branching and merging strategies, 
are established and documented within the GitHub repository.

**G002.6.** The GitHub repository is configured to enable issue tracking, 
allowing team members to report and address project-related issues effectively.

**Dependencies/References:**

- No dependencies were found.

## 3. Analysis

*During the analysis phase, the team carefully evaluated several factors to determine the most suitable tools for setting 
up the project repository and project management.* 
 - One of the primary considerations was the choice of version control system,
which is foundational for collaborative software development. 
 - GitHub emerged as a top contender due to its widespread adoption, robust features, 
and seamless integration with other development tools and services.
 - GitHub offers a user-friendly interface and intuitive workflows, 
making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.

*In conclusion, after an analysis considering factors such as ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost, 
the team determined that GitHub was the optimal choice for setting up the project repository and project management.
 Its comprehensive feature set, seamless integration with development tools, and flexible pricing plans make it a versatile 
platform that meets the needs of modern software development teams.*

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

*The chosen solution involves creating a GitHub repository with a name that accurately reflects the project's purpose or name. 
 The repository serves as a centralized location for storing all project-related files, including source code, documentation,
and any supplementary resources.*
*The repository allows team members to report and address project-related issues effectively, fostering a proactive 
approach to problem-solving and project management.*

### 4.2. Class Diagram

*As this aspect of the requirement pertains more to project setup and configuration rather than software design, 
a class diagram is not applicable in this context.*

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

*No specific design patterns are applied in this scenario, as the focus is on setting up the project repository on 
GitHub rather than implementing software functionality.*

### 4.4. Tests
- Given the nature of this requirement, direct testing is not applicable. 
However, the success of this step can be validated through manual inspection and verification,
ensuring that the GitHub repository is created with an appropriate name and configured according to the project's needs

## 5. Implementation

*There was no implementation required.* 

## 6. Integration/Demonstration
*Integration efforts involved ensuring seamless collaboration between team members 
within the GitHub repository and utilizing project management tools for efficient 
task tracking and communication.*  
*This integration enhances overall project organization and productivity.*

## 7. Observations

*We opted for GitHub due to its popularity, robust features, and seamless integration capabilities.
However, it's important to note that GitHub might pose a learning curve for team members unfamiliar with version control systems.
Training and support will be crucial to ensure smooth adoption.*

* While GitHub was our choice, alternatives like GitLab and Bitbucket were considered.
GitLab offers self-hosting options, which may be beneficial for organizations with strict data privacy requirements.
Meanwhile, Jira and Trello provide comprehensive project management features, suitable for agile methodologies.

* Our decision was informed by various resources, including official documentation from GitHub and community forums.
These resources provided valuable insights into best practices for project repository management and version control.

*By selecting GitHub and considering potential challenges and alternatives, we aim to establish a solid foundation for
collaborative software development while ensuring ease of use and effective project management.*
